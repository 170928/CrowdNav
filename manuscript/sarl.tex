\section{INTRODUCTION} \label{sec:intro}

* Here's a fascinating question

Autonomous navigation through a crowd of pedestrians / agents in a socially compliant manner. 

\vspace{2cm}

* Here's what people have tried to do (in brief: not a full related work section, but a high level assesment):

- Reaction

- Prediction and then planning

- Planning model that incorporates social interaction 

\vspace{2cm}

* Here's the key challenge preventing further progress: 

Models that effectively encodes the social interactions for rl. 

\vspace{2cm}

* Voila: here's our awesome solution (additionally) and here's how it works.

Pair-wise interaction feature, soft attention, social pooling, local/global occupancy map.

Capable of accurately estimating the value of the crowd scenarios with respect to social navigation, and effectively learning a socially-compliant navigation policy.

% \subsection{System Structure}

\addtolength{\textheight}{-10cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
