\section{INTRODUCTION} \label{sec:intro}

With the rapid growth of machine intelligence, robots are envisioned to expand habitats from isolated environments to social spaces that are shared with humans and other embodied agents. Traditional approaches for robot navigation often consider this as a static or one-step reactive problem [TODO], resulting in short-sighted behaviors. In order to navigate through a crowd in a socially compliant manner, robot needs the ability to understand the others' behavior and take that into account while making its motion decision. 

Autonomous navigation with the socially cooperative thinking is, however, a very challenging task. First, a model is required to perceive and predict others' behaviors, when communication is not widely available amoung agents. Pioneering works have proposed several methods to model the agent-agent interactions \cite{helbing_social_1995}. Though effective in simple scenarios, these hand-crafted feature functions can hardly generalize well to complex scene. Recent works try to learn the social interaction by a data-drive approach and present promising results \cite{alahi_social_2016,vemula_social_2017,gupta_social_2018}. 

Given a predictive model, how to integrate the interaction knowledge into the decision making process poses another challenge. 

A set of methods address this issue by splitting the prediction and planning [TODO]. 

Recent research in 
- Learn a planning model that incorporates social interaction \cite{chen_decentralized_2016,chen_socially_2017,everett_motion_2018}

However, the feature-loss dimension reduction limits its capablity of planning-based reasoning in complex and crowded scenarios.

In this work, we propose a model that can effectively address challenge of the social interaction reinforcement leanring. Draw aspiration from, we extend the social pooling module to spatial interaction, and embed it into the rl framework. The propsed model use 

Models that effectively encodes the social interactions for rl.

* Voila: here's our awesome solution (additionally) and here's how it works.

Pair-wise interaction feature, soft attention, social pooling, local/global occupancy map.

Capable of accurately estimating the value of the crowd scenarios with respect to social navigation, and effectively learning a socially-compliant navigation policy. 

An extensive set of simulation experiments shows that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
